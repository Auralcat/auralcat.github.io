title: How I got into Linux
---

So here's the story about my involvement with GNU/Linux distributions.

My first contact was with Ubuntu in the college library's
computers. At first I was like "omg, what's this? It's different from
Windows, all the icons are on the left and... what's this
terminal?". I was very curious about the system, checking out all the
different programs that came with it like GIMP... exploring all that
stuff.

Later on I picked up a computer running Fedora, didn't get to use it
much, another college property. Still, that attracted my attention.
"What's this about distros?".

Then Windows 10 happened. All the notifications in the taskbar saying
"get Windows 10 now for free!" and that nagging stuff. And that was
before knowing about the privacy practices.

There were some guys who were Linux heads and I hanged out with
them. I was getting the hang of Bash using Cygwin, loving how easy it
was to install stuff using the command line (that was one of the
experiences I had in college). And the desire to get out of Windows
got bigger, even more so because at that time my laptop was getting
slower and older with each new update.

So that's why I changed the operating system. I wanted to use the real
shell, not just Cygwin, there was Windows issues and... I liked that
different interface too! Because it was different from what everyone
had. Sure, there are Macs and OS X, I got to use some too, not that
much, and it felt strange.

The biggest hurdle was backing up all the files. There were lots of
stuff I was hoarding back then: music, notes, books... sure, the plan
was to dual boot. Despite that, what if I messed up the installation?
Then I needed to pick up a distro. I did a lot of music production
using FL Studio on Windows and that was important to me. Then people
pointed me to Ubuntu Studio and I went with it. That's the only
program I had a hard time replacing, LMMS isn't quite the same
thing. The low-latency kernel was a huge plus, helps a lot with recording.

Now to the music player. I like reviewing the music I listen to,
grading them, and most players just play the music, they don't come
with that feature. In Windows there was MusicBee... and there's no
Linux version. Running it using Wine didn't cross my mind. Then I
found Guayadeque, it works fine.

The good thing about migrating from one OS to another nowadays is that
the most common programs people use are cross-platform. The ones
they'll miss the most are the Microsoft Office suite, now it's got a
different name. For everything else, people use browsers like Chrome
or Firefox and they run in most places. I got my dad to switch to
Linux Mint later on and that's all he ever used. Another plus was that
he was used to LibreOffice and other FOSS programs.

The migration itself took a couple days, until I got used to the new
system and put the files in all the right places. I got to learn a lot
about configuring stuff and didn't really miss Windows. Even for
games. My gaming is usually emulators and they have better versions in
Linux. Didn't really miss that part.
